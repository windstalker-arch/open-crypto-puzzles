# open-crypto-puzzles

Someone hides a crypto wallet inside a puzzle, publishes the address, and dares the internet
to solve it and keep what is in it. These are real, still unsolved, and the coins are sitting
on-chain right now.

## Still unsolved, sitting on-chain

*The biggest unsolved prizes on-chain right now. Regenerated from the manifests by `tools/fig_readme_totals.py`.*

I am floflo777. I worked about 40 of these and solved a few (0.5 ETH and about 0.01 BTC).
This is my research on the rest: for every puzzle, the address, the author's clues, what I
tried, and where I got stuck. Pick one and keep going.

## How to read this repository

1. Pick a tier below. Prizes are grouped by USD value at the snapshot date.
2. Open the puzzle folder. `README.md` is the whole story: clues, mechanism, tested, leads.
3. Before any effort, re-check the escrow yourself: click the explorer link in "At a glance"
   or read [docs/verify-funding.md](docs/verify-funding.md). The chain is the truth, not this file.
4. `analysis/tested.md` is what not to redo. `analysis/leads.md` is where to start.
5. If you solve one: sweep first, then tell people. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## How to use it with an AI agent

Point your agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or any other) at [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). It
contains the rules and a starter prompt. The machine-readable index is
[puzzles.json](puzzles.json); each folder has a `puzzle.json` and, when the derivation is
known, `tools/oracle.py --selftest`.

## Engines

The GPU and CPU bruteforce engines I use on these puzzles are in [engines/](engines/): a
checksum-aware BIP39 seed and passphrase kernel (about 790k derivations/s), a brainwallet
`SHA256 -> secp256k1 -> hash160` kernel (about 9.3M keys/s), an Electrum v1 old-seed engine,
and two Arweave key-stretch engines. They ship as CUDA source plus Python host drivers with
self-tests; build them with `engines/build.sh` (nvcc), then point one at a puzzle's target.
See [engines/README.md](engines/README.md).

The nonce side of ECDSA is documented separately in
[docs/phantom-curve-attack.md](docs/phantom-curve-attack.md): how a repeated or weak nonce
gives up a signing key, what the interval discrete log costs on this phone, and the boundary I
hold when running it.

## Start here: twelve to look at first

If you do not know where to begin, these twelve are the clearest to pick up. The full list,
grouped by prize, is in the tables below.

| Puzzle | Prize | Why it is a good place to start |
|---|---|---|
| [Keir Finlow-Bates: book treasure hunt](2-mid-prizes/keir-finlow-bates-blockchain-book-600ksats/) | 600,000 sats open, 4 lots solved | I solved 4 of its 12 lots; the write-ups show exactly how the author hides a key, which is the strongest lead for the 3 still open. |
| [Corey Phillips: kitten passphrase](2-mid-prizes/corey-phillips-kitten-passphrase-1msats/) | 0.01 BTC | The seed is fixed and public; only one BIP39 passphrase is missing. A clean, bounded target to point a tool at. |
| [Keysa: Crack the Seed](2-mid-prizes/keysa-crack-the-seed-369ksats/) | 369,369 sats | Seventy words are printed on a card; twelve of them are the seed. The whole puzzle is picking the right twelve in the right order. |
| [GSMG.io puzzle](1-big-prizes/gsmg-io-5btc-puzzle/) | up to 5 BTC | A famous multi-stage hunt; every stage but the last is solved. The final gate is two sealed AES blobs. |
| [Guntis Vitolins MetaMask seed](1-big-prizes/guntis-vitolins-metamask-8-6eth/) | 8.61 ETH | The largest prize here. A 12-word seed scattered across the author's own clues. |
| [Ballet / Bobby Lee cards](1-big-prizes/ballet-bobby-lee-2btc-cards/) | 2 BTC | Two physical Ballet cards, 1 BTC each. Each needs one hidden half that was never photographed. |
| [Aoi Nakamoto Quizchain](1-big-prizes/aoi-nakamoto-quizchain-0-854btc/) | 0.854 BTC | The key comes from a Wattpad chapter run through MD5. The rule is certified on a solved sibling block. |
| [BLM collage seed](1-big-prizes/blm-brave-new-world-0-2btc/) | 0.2 BTC | A whole seed hidden inside one large collage image: runes, micro-text, a clock. |
| [Arweave Puzzle #11](2-mid-prizes/arweave-puzzle-11-1eth/) | 1 ETH | A single grayscale sketch that encodes a raw 64-hex private key. |
| [LogicBeach: Powerful Moss](2-mid-prizes/logicbeach-powerful-moss-0-54eth/) | 0.55 ETH | A 12-word seed spread across the 12 tracks of an album. The artist's two earlier hunts really paid out. |
| [Smith, Lyle & Moore Hunt #2](2-mid-prizes/smith-lyle-moore-hunt-2-0-032btc/) | 0.032 BTC | A tree of password-locked web pages; each page you open hands you a fragment of the seed. |

Puzzles that turned out swept, unfunded, custodial, or fake are kept off the lists above, in
[archive/dead-ends/](archive/dead-ends/), for anyone curious about the ones that did not pan out.

## Series

- Arweave puzzles: #3, #10, #11, #12 open; #8 solved by others is the oracle calibration.
- Zden (crypto.haluska.sk): LVL5 and HALV open; earlier levels solved by others.
- FTPK: seasons 2 and 4 open; seasons 1 and 3 finished and still playable, used to learn the author's grammar.
- Finlow-Bates "Blockchain book": 12 lots, 3 open, 4 solved by me, 5 by others.
- Aoi Nakamoto Quizchain: Real Big Block and Block 76 open; Block 77 Stage One reproduced.

## On-chain check policy

Every address in this repository was checked within 30 days before publication; the date is
in each table and each `puzzle.json`. Prices and balances move. Run
`python3 tools/check_escrows.py` for a fresh table, or open the explorer links. If you find a
drift, open an issue with the txid.

## Method, in short

Oracle first: reproduce a known-good vector before searching. A negative counts only with a
witness. A solution is an exact match, character for character. Insight over compute: if a
run needs hours, the constraint has not been found yet. Details: [docs/methodology.md](docs/methodology.md).

## Disclaimer

These are public puzzles. Each reward was funded and published by the puzzle's own author,
who invited the public to solve it and take it. Nothing here targets a third party's wallet,
lost keys, or private data. Solving one of these puzzles is what the author asked for. I do
not guarantee that any escrow is still funded when you read this: check the chain. I am not
affiliated with any puzzle author. Do not send funds to any address in this repository.
