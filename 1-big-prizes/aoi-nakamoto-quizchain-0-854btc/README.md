# Aoi Nakamoto Quizchain (0.777 BTC, [OPEN])

AoiNakamoto, a pseudonymous Reddit user, ran a series of roughly 90 self-funded
Bitcoin puzzle blocks from April to October 2019 on r/bitcoinpuzzles and her own
r/Grycoin, each with its own escrow address, question, and prize. She stopped
posting in October 2019 without ever reclaiming her own puzzle funds. Every
block was solved and swept by readers except the last two she published: the
second and final stage of "Real Big Block" (0.777 BTC) and "Quizchain2 Block
76" (0.077 BTC). Real Big Block is still funded seven years later; Block 76 was
solved and swept by a reader on 2026-08-17 (tx
`2e271ac2f63f488cd14112bceeed56f159ecd98cb3ce753f08e2d94bb62714a3`), so only Real
Big Block, 0.777 BTC, remains open. The MD5-to-BIP39
derivation mechanism is confirmed exactly, including a case-flip rule proven on
a solved sibling lot; what remains is the precise source text for Real Big
Block.

| What remains | Real Big Block: the exact source text the author hashed on 2019-07-30 (the transform and rule are confirmed); she removed one "twist" that day and kept at least one, and later wrote that she lost the solution herself. Block 76 was solved and swept by a reader on 2026-08-17, so it is no longer open |
| Series | this folder covers Real Big Block, the last open lot of the approximately 90-block Quizchain series; the rest, including Block 76 (August 2026), were solved by other readers |

## The puzzle as published

AoiNakamoto's last two blocks, in order:

Real Big Block stage 1, 2019-07-07
([reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/ca6jxv](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/ca6jxv/77_mbtc_quizchain2_block_77_stage_one/)):
"I do disclose that this one has no TOMI field, but that is all. You are on your
own completely." Its question links to Hal Finney's "Bitcoin and me" post on
bitcointalk (topic 155054). She adds: "I will publish the complete solution as
the Second stage of this block. This solution will in turn be the question for
the Second stage, which will have the final 777 mbtc prize." This stage's
escrow, `19TbyN5KCg1Lg7qHwezifsLVcdSa2Rj5KN`, was solved and swept on
2019-08-03; it is not part of the live prize and is used in this folder only to
certify the case-flip rule (see "What is understood").

Quizchain2 Block 76, 2019-07-22
([reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/cgcv9i](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/cgcv9i/77_mbtc_quizchain2_block_76/)):
"Question: change to", "Format: [solution] TOMI [TOMI]", "First three digits of
MD5 hash are f8e". A later update adds "First two digits of solution only are
1d", and a hint changes the question to "from change to". She adds: "I will
shut down soon now [...] so I will not be available for hints or questions."

Real Big Block stage 2, published as a chapter titled "Second" on the author's
own Wattpad account
([wattpad.com/720888559-second](https://www.wattpad.com/720888559-second)). In
the "Real Big Block Discussion" thread
([reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/chn8un](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grycoin/comments/chn8un/real_big_block_discussion/)),
she writes, 2019-07-25: "When I posted the real big block at the Wattpad site,
I added extra line breaks between paragraphs. This information is needed to
solve the block." On 2019-07-31, after moving the funds to the current escrow:
"I took back the prize for a moment and sent it again to a new address, hashing
with a slightly different solution [...] It has multiple paragraphs and two
line breaks between each of them."

## What is understood

### Mechanism

Every block in the series follows the same transform: MD5 the exact bytes of a
source text to get 128 bits of entropy, generate a BIP39 mnemonic from that
entropy, derive BIP44 path `m/44'/0'/0'/0/i` (the author confirms taking a low
index, typically the first), and compare the resulting P2PKH address to the
block's escrow. Block 76 additionally uses a `[solution] TOMI [tomi]` format,
where TOMI (Japanese for "wealth") is a second, separately-hinted field: an
anti-brute-force device, since guessing the solution alone is not enough to
reach the hash.

![Source text to P2PKH address, five stages linked by MD5, BIP39 and BIP44](images/01-pipeline-derivation.svg)
*Figure 1. The MD5-to-address derivation pipeline (source: data/pipeline-stages.json, script tools/fig_pipeline.py), 2026-08-16.*

For Real Big Block, the exact source text is confirmed to be the "Second"
chapter, with a case-flip rule applied to some of its paragraphs, not the
chapter's raw text. This rule is proven on the solved sibling lot Block 77
Stage One: of that post's 16 paragraphs, the 4 whose first letter is not I, T,
A, S or M get their first letter lowercased and their last letter uppercased,
and the paragraphs are joined with a blank line; this reproduces
`19TbyN5KCg1Lg7qHwezifsLVcdSa2Rj5KN` exactly. The "Second" chapter contains the
same paragraph-initial pattern 3 times on its own, plus a quotation from the
Finney post, but no combination of applying the rule to these 4 candidate
groups (nor to the many related selections in `analysis/tested.md`) reproduces
either the current or the superseded Real Big Block address. The Wattpad API
confirms the chapter's `modifyDate` as 2019-07-23T23:12:04Z, 7 days before the
current escrow was funded, so the text available today predates the funding and
is very likely the version that was hashed; what is not settled is which exact
byte sequence the author's own tool read from it. This chapter's stored form
has no blank paragraphs; other Wattpad chapters from the same week still do
(see "Open leads").

For Block 76, a community player found, in 2019, that `solution = "format"`,
`tomi = "before TOMI"` satisfies both published MD5-prefix hints (`1d` and
`f8e`); the free filter for checking this yourself is
`tools/oracle.py --block76-filter`. No standard derivation of this pair reaches
the escrow address, and the author never corrected the block after the pair was
posted publicly, which argues this chain is a coincidental false positive
rather than her real answer (see "What has been tested").

### Derivation and oracle

```
python3 tools/oracle.py --selftest
python3 tools/oracle.py "<candidate text>"
python3 tools/oracle.py --stdin
python3 tools/oracle.py --block76-filter "<solution>" "<tomi>"
python3 tools/oracle.py --flip-case "<one paragraph>"
```

Given a candidate text, the oracle MD5s its UTF-8 bytes, derives BIP44 indices 0
through 5, and compares each resulting address against both open escrows.
`--block76-filter` checks the 2 free MD5-prefix hints before any derivation.
`--flip-case` applies the confirmed Stage One rule to one paragraph you supply.
This script ships no source text of its own: Real Big Block's source (a Wattpad
chapter) and the Stage One certification text (a bitcointalk post by Hal
Finney) are both excluded, the first as bulk chapter content and the second as
third-party historical material neither the puzzle's author nor this repository
holds the rights to. Supply your own candidate text to test it.

### Certified against

`tools/oracle.py --selftest` reproduces the author's own published calibration
vector, given in the round-1 corpus: entropy `2941774a2abec9f30c7d6777d1d53d91`,
at BIP44 index 1 ("my 2nd private key"), derives WIF
`L5Z66qPmUkTAsWQywjRNHDxHrX6J1X1SQedp6V8QsbaXR7rGd6ex` exactly, and that WIF
appears at no other index. This certifies the MD5-to-address transform itself,
without needing any third-party text. The selftest also checks the
`--flip-case` helper against a synthetic (non-puzzle) example sentence, and the
`--block76-filter` helper against the community-found `format` / `before TOMI`
pair.

This does not, by itself, reproduce Block 77 Stage One end to end, since that
needs Hal Finney's bitcointalk post text, which this repository does not ship.
Anyone who supplies that text (freely readable at bitcointalk topic 155054) can
reproduce it themselves with `apply_stage_one_rule()` in `tools/oracle.py`; I
did this during research and it reproduces `19TbyN5KCg1Lg7qHwezifsLVcdSa2Rj5KN`
exactly, which is the basis for the case-flip rule described above.

Reproduced 2026-08-16.

### Established facts

1. Real Big Block is funded and unspent as of 2026-08-27:
   `14zMkTgaVXJcxdh4JdWi29MLRR44iUSG9W` holds 0.777 BTC (funded 2019-07-30,
   block 587833), checked via [mempool.space](https://mempool.space). Block 76's
   escrow `13Cv6SXUnzGDT8JHqzzJ8xMPtsSdhJA4wd` was funded 2019-07-22 (block
   586468) and was swept by a reader on 2026-08-17.
2. Across the approximately 90 blocks of the series, these were the only 2 still
   funded after 2019: an exhaustive sweep of all 159 funding transactions cited
   in the author's 202 Reddit posts found 0 unreadable transactions and exactly
   these 2 unspent above 100,000 sats. Only Real Big Block remains funded.
3. The MD5-to-BIP39-to-BIP44 transform is confirmed exactly against the
   author's own published calibration vector (above).
4. The case-flip rule is confirmed exactly against the solved sibling lot Block
   77 Stage One (above), reproducing its escrow address byte for byte.
5. The Real Big Block chapter's Wattpad `modifyDate` (2019-07-23) predates the
   current escrow's funding (2019-07-30) by 7 days, and the chapter has not
   been modified since, confirmed via the Wattpad API.
6. No archived capture of the "Second" Wattpad chapter from 2019 exists on the
   Wayback Machine, archive.today, or Common Crawl, checked across 8 URL forms
   and 5 time-windowed collections; a positive control query on each service
   confirms the services themselves were responding, so these are true absences
   in the archive, not failed lookups.
7. The chain `MD5("format") ` starts with `1d` and `MD5("format TOMI before TOMI")`
   starts with `f8e`, matching both prefixes the author published for Block 76;
   neither of 2 other independently solved calibration blocks (73 and 74) shows
   any sign this chain is the author's real answer.
8. July 2019 Wattpad story pages in Common Crawl (CC-MAIN-2019-30) SSR-render
   inside a classless `<pre>` with a newline plus 26 spaces between `<p>` tags,
   and some of those chapters still store empty paragraphs as
   `<p data-p-id="d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e"><br></p>`. The homepage
   that week linked
   `a.wattpad.com/css/desktop-web/desktop-web.min.css?v=eb03e30` (2019-07-15),
   later `v=28f4664` (2019-07-21). Those CSS bytes are not archived; a
   2019-08-15 userstyle copies Wattpad's generic `pre { white-space: pre-wrap }`   rule. The "Second" chapter is still absent from that crawl.
9. The author removed "one of the twists" when she rehashed on 2019-07-30 ("The
   block is now slightly easier", `clues/author-posts.md`), so the current escrow's
   text still carries at least one twist beyond the case-flip rule; and in a later
   Wattpad part she wrote that she "lost any information on the solution of that
   one". Nobody, including the author, holds the exact hashed string today.
10. No MD5 prefix was ever published for Real Big Block (checked across her 202
    posts and comments), unlike Block 76's `1d` and `f8e`. There is no free filter:
    every candidate has to go through the full derivation.
11. Block 76's solver (2026-08-17) swept it from an active wallet whose only puzzle
    input is that block; no other Aoi escrow was touched. That person holds the
    exact serialization convention of a final Aoi block, which nobody else does.

Cumulative: approximately 272 million candidates tested against Real Big Block
through 2026-08-15, about 1,300 chapter-rule and section variants on 2026-08-21,
48,379,696 boundary 2-edits on 2026-08-23, plus 12,848 unique 2019-copy
serializations, 3,030 unique 2019-indent/empty-`<p><br></p>` serializations,
1,469,908 unique contiguous spans, and 221,520 unique bounded 2-edits on
2026-08-27 (AppleLamps), plus 17,921 unique Finney-group and first/last
N-paragraph serializations, and approximately 78 million derivations plus
approximately 78,000 smaller candidates tested against Block 76, all negative. Full scope notes, including which rows are complete
sweeps versus targeted tests, are in `analysis/tested.md`.

## Open leads, ranked

1. **Ask the Block 76 solver for the convention of a final Aoi block** (needs a
   person, no compute). The reader who swept Block 76 on 2026-08-17 knows the exact
   serialization, derivation index and whether a "twist" sat on top of the stated
   rule for a block written by the same author in the same week with the same
   tooling. That calibrates Real Big Block directly. Confirmed by a convention that,
   applied to the chapter, matches; killed by a convention that adds nothing to
   what is already swept.
2. **A bounded 2-character-edit sweep on the strongest base texts** (about an
   hour on a rented GPU). Every contiguous copy-paste span of the chapter is a
   negative, and two slices of this lead are too: every NBSP subset and every pair
   of joins swapped between `\n\n` and `\r\n\r\n` on the full chapter
   (221,520 texts, AppleLamps), and every pair of boundary edits, invisible
   characters at two joins or one insertion plus one boundary case toggle, on 16
   certified bases (48,379,696 texts, 4 witnesses per base). If the remaining twist
   is a copy artefact it is 3 or more edits, or inside a paragraph, or the source
   differs from today's Wattpad storage. Confirmed by a match in a narrower
   2-edit family; killed by exhausting it with none.
3. **A non-uniform editor buffer, or a non-contiguous selection** (needs a
   narrower reason). Uniform empty `<p><br></p>` and SSR indent contradict her
   `13 10 13 10` ASCII note and are already negatives. Sparse gaps or a subset
   other than the 17 already swept is what remains. Confirmed by such a buffer
   matching; killed if a reason appears that she copy-pasted a contiguous
   range (already tested).
4. **All 2-character edits on the 8 certified bases, on a rented GPU** (4 to 5 GPU-hours, low
   expected value). All 2-character edits at all positions of the 8 certified
   bases is about 2e9 candidates per base; it tests "the twist is within 2
   characters of the base" without the boundary restriction. Not proposed before
   lead 1, since a twist an author chose need not be 2 characters.
