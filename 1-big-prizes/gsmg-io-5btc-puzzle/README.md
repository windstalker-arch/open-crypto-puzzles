# GSMG.io Puzzle (1.2563451 BTC, [OPEN])

GSMG.io, a Netherlands-based crypto-trading platform introduced publicly in
January 2019, funded a multi-stage web puzzle with 5 BTC on 2019-04-13 and
challenged the public to solve it and keep the coins. The creator announced in
April 2019 that the reward would halve at every Bitcoin halving, and it did: 2.5 BTC
left the prize address in the first block after the 2020 halving and 1.25 BTC four
days after the 2024 one, so the live prize is the 1.2563451 BTC still held at the
original address. The 3.75 BTC moved out sits at a second address that has never
spent and has no published payout path. The puzzle chains cryptograms, an image, and
several classical ciphers across a dozen web pages; every stage since 2019 has been
passed by the community. What remains is the final gate: two still-locked
OpenSSL-format AES blobs with unknown passwords, a small one and a much larger one
nicknamed "Dualite" in the page's own markup.
The mechanical chain from the published page down to each blob is fully mapped and
reproducible; what is missing is the password (or, on the older readings, a direct
32-byte reduction) that opens either one.

## The puzzle as published

The puzzle's escrow address, `1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe`, received its
first funding, exactly 5 BTC in a single transaction, on 2019-04-13
([txid `73e48ff5...`](https://mempool.space/tx/73e48ff571a7e9a4387574a50cf2fcb7b21b6ea5702c777a035664df57cbce02)).
GSMG.io itself, [gsmg.io](https://www.gsmg.io/), presents itself as an automated
crypto-trading platform; the puzzle is a separate, unpaid challenge run from the
same domain.

The puzzle is a chain of web pages, each unlocked by solving the one before it. A
community-maintained repository documents the public stage order
([github.com/puzzlehunt/gsmgio-5btc-puzzle](https://github.com/puzzlehunt/gsmgio-5btc-puzzle)),
and a bitcointalk thread has discussed the puzzle since 2025
([topic 5532424](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5532424.0)): an opening
cryptogram, three numbered "phase" pages, an image page ("the seed is planted"), a
substitution-cipher page nicknamed "SalPhaseIon", a page called "follow the white
rabbit", a branching page called "the Architect Choice", and a final page. Every
stage in this chain has been passed by the community since 2019.

The final page's body is a sequence of 1075 single-character tokens. Decoded
through the page's own straightforward transforms (binary-to-ASCII on two marked
sections), two of those tokens spell out, verbatim: `matrixsumlist` and
`ourfirsthintisyourlastcommand`. The same page also embeds a 14x14 pixel image and
two base64-encoded text blocks in two separate `<textarea>` elements, the second one
titled "Dualite" in the page's own markup.

The two outgoing transactions from `1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe` are the
creator's own halvings of the prize, not payouts. In April 2019 the creator announced
in the puzzle's Telegram group that the reward would be halved at Bitcoin block
630,000 and again every 210,000 blocks; Y0lan collected the message ids in
[issue #15](https://github.com/floflo777/open-crypto-puzzles/issues/15) (taken as
given here, the group has no stable public URL), and the community repository's
README states the same rule. On chain, which I re-checked on 2026-09-03: in block
630,001, the first block after the 2020 halving, 2.5 BTC moved from
`1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe` to a new address,
`17ucy1K9ZUAaoY6JVtM932W9jUp5LXfyHa`
([txid `2aa9a4a9...`](https://mempool.space/tx/2aa9a4a90be819d5122d70c993280785a0508f163521e7b38cebb4db0b071b13),
locktime 629,998). The same block carries an `OP_RETURN` reading `Halving`, sent from
the creator's vanity address `3GSMG24TujqfMJG1kQoBX18DzJHQLeJYMK` with a 700-satoshi
output to the prize address
([txid `a798905f...`](https://mempool.space/tx/a798905f53fdcadcbd2e2a1e61d23ba69a07e26130a78c76da4bf4d7a170f383)),
and the split spends that output as its third input. On 2024-04-24, four days after
the 2024 halving, 1.25 BTC moved the same way
([txid `88cdb3cd...`](https://mempool.space/tx/88cdb3cdca12b471551b1b26188508a14ca5fd8a415223ffb7c190381c9b9df3),
locktime 840,003). These are the only two spends in the prize address's history; the
remainder came back to it as change, and the small excess over 5 and 2.5 BTC on the
inputs is third-party dust. `17ucy1K9ZUAaoY6JVtM932W9jUp5LXfyHa` has never spent. No
published statement says it pays out to a solver, and Y0lan reports that when a
member asked directly in 2023 whether it does, the creator did not answer. I count
the live prize as the `1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe` balance.

## What is understood

### Mechanism

Reaching the final page requires solving a chain of classical ciphers across the
stage sequence in Figure 1: a Vigenere-family cipher, a Bifid cipher applied to a
570-character segment with the keyed square `DBIFHCEG` and a period equal to the
full segment length, and a bit-plane reading of a 14x14 pixel image (the low bit of
each pixel's color, read in a spiral from the top-left corner, spells the ASCII
string `gsmg.io/theseedisplanted`). The Bifid step's output splits into two
interleaved streams; the odd-position stream, with the two Base58-ambiguous letters
I and O removed, reduces to exactly 256 symbols drawn from a 23-letter alphabet.
Every attempt so far to turn that 256-symbol object directly into a 32-byte private
key has failed (see "What has been tested").

The archived Phase 2 and Phase 3 page (Wayback capture of 2020-11-12 of
[`gsmg.io/choiceisanillusion...`](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112015439/https://gsmg.io/choiceisanillusioncreatedbetweenthosewithpowerandthosewithoutaveryspecialdessertiwroteitmyself)) states the puzzle's own
convention in the creator's words: "Ciphered with aes-256-cbc /w base64
sha-256(password)" and, for the seven-part phase 3 answer, "parts 1..7 -> sha-256 ->
dgst is the password". The OpenSSL password is the lowercase hex SHA-256 of the
answer, with a one-round EVP key derivation on SHA-256, and the whole solved chain
replays from archived material: the phase 2 answer opens a plaintext of 7 numbered
riddles; the 7 parts concatenated (227 characters) open the phase 3 plaintext; the
phase 3.2 answer opens a plaintext that carries the Architect's monologue as a
Beaufort block (key `thematrixhasyou`, after an EBCDIC transcoding), a 149-digit
string, a checkerboard riddle, and a further OpenSSL blob, "phase 3.2.2", never
opened. The 149 digits decode through a straddling checkerboard with escapes 1 and 4
("One for one, four for one" in the same plaintext) to the 91-letter phrase.

Two corrections to this folder follow from that replay. The Architect's monologue is
the phase 3.2 plaintext, not the text of the final page: the final page holds two
titles, the 1075 tokens and the large blob, nothing else, and six captures from
2023-06 to 2026-04 differ only in whitespace, the case of one tag and a script tag.
And there are two locks of the same shape, not one: the phase 3.2.2 blob of 2019,
preceded in its plaintext by "the private keys belong to half and better half", and
the SalPhaseIon small blob of 2021 are both `Salted__` containers with 80 bytes of
ciphertext (64 to 80 bytes of plaintext). Every password candidate is now tested
against both.

The SalPhaseIon page,
`gsmg.io/89727c598b9cd1cf8873f27cb7057f050645ddb6a7a157a110239ac0152f6a32`, reached by
hashing the text of the first puzzle page rather than through the Architect Choice,
publishes a small OpenSSL "Salted__" AES-256-CBC blob (96
bytes total: 8-byte header, 8-byte salt `3ab585348552415d`, 80 bytes of ciphertext,
enough for a 64-byte plaintext after PKCS7 padding). The password is reported to be
`sha256(X).hexdigest()` for an answer string X the solver must find; this repository
ships an oracle for exactly this half of the final gate (below). The page's second,
much larger blob, titled "Dualite", is confirmed by direct measurement (byte
histogram and autocorrelation) to be well-formed AES-CBC ciphertext rather than
noise or a decorative filler value, but no password has ever been found for it.
Whether the "Dualite" blob gates `17ucy1K9ZUAaoY6JVtM932W9jUp5LXfyHa` at all is
unconfirmed: the coins there were moved out under the halving rule, the creator has
never said they pay out, and nothing published links that blob to that address (see
"The puzzle as published"). I no longer count them as prize.

![Candidate answer to P2PKH address, six stages linked by sha256, AES-256-CBC decryption, secp256k1 and HASH160](images/02-pipeline-derivation.svg)
*Figure 2. The final-gate derivation pipeline `tools/oracle.py` implements for the small blob (source: data/pipeline-stages.json, script tools/fig_pipeline.py), 2026-08-16.*

### Derivation and oracle

```
python3 tools/oracle.py --selftest
python3 tools/oracle.py "<candidate answer>"
python3 tools/oracle.py --stdin
```

Given a candidate answer string X, the oracle computes `sha256(X).hexdigest()` as
the password, decrypts the small blob printed on the final page with that
password, and, if the PKCS7 padding validates, tries 4 standard readings of the
resulting plaintext (the plaintext's own SHA-256; its first 32 bytes; its last 32
bytes; the SHA-256 of its first 64 bytes) as a 32-byte private key. For each
reading it derives the uncompressed secp256k1 public key and compares the P2PKH
address against `1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe`. `MATCH <address>
reading=<name> priv_hex=<hex> wif=<wif>` on a hit, `NO MATCH` otherwise, exit code
0 or 1. This oracle does not test the "Dualite" blob or
`17ucy1K9ZUAaoY6JVtM932W9jUp5LXfyHa`, since no password-generation hypothesis for
that blob has more support than any other (see `analysis/leads.md`).

This is a different, and independently reproducible, check from the puzzle's own
answer-checking tool referenced informally by some solvers, which is not published
and which this repository has no access to.

### Certified against

`tools/oracle.py --selftest` certifies the pipeline's two halves independently. X is
unsolved, so no vector exists for the answer string itself, but the puzzle's earlier
stages do provide real blobs with known passwords for the decryption half:

1. **Address derivation**: the escrow's own uncompressed public key, recovered from
   its 2024-04-24 spending transaction
   ([txid `88cdb3cd...`](https://mempool.space/tx/88cdb3cdca12b471551b1b26188508a14ca5fd8a415223ffb7c190381c9b9df3)),
   `04f4d1bbd91e65e2a019566a17574e97dae908b784b388891848007e4f55d5a4649c73d25fc5ed8fd7227cab0be4e576c0c6404db5aa546286563e4be12bf33559`,
   hashes byte-exact to `1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe`. This certifies the
   HASH160-plus-Base58Check half of the pipeline against a real, independently
   checkable fact.
2. **AES decrypt**: the puzzle's own phase-2 blob, whose password is the known stage
   answer `sha256("causality")`, decrypts to its known plaintext under
   EVP_BytesToKey with SHA-256, and produces no valid PKCS7 padding under a wrong
   password. A third check asserts that EVP_BytesToKey with MD5 fails on that
   particular blob. This replaces an earlier synthetic round-trip vector, which could
   not detect a wrong digest because it encrypted and decrypted with the same
   derivation. Note that the puzzle uses both digests: phases 2 and 3 use SHA-256,
   while the Cosmic Duality blob uses MD5 (see `analysis/tested.md` sections 10 and
   11). Since the small blob's password is unknown, its digest cannot be determined,
   and the oracle tries both.
3. The published blob itself is confirmed to decode to the documented shape: 96
   bytes, header `Salted__`, salt `3ab585348552415d`.

Reproduced 2026-08-16.

### Planted addresses: an exact offline oracle for every stage

The creator's vanity wallet `3GSMG24TujqfMJG1kQoBX18DzJHQLeJYMK`
([explorer](https://mempool.space/address/3GSMG24TujqfMJG1kQoBX18DzJHQLeJYMK))
funded, on 2020-03-24, 2020-04-03 and 2020-04-07, a series of P2PKH addresses, most
with an `OP_RETURN` message. For six of them the private key is the SHA-256 of a
stage answer, address in compressed form: `causality` ("GSMG.io: Right, this is
causality"), the phase 1.2 flower sentence ("GSMG.io: are you sure?"), the
227-character concatenation of parts 1 to 7 ("GSMG.io: You are here because 227
chars were correct"), the phase 3.2 answer ("GSMG.io: phase3.2 pass OK"), the
149-digit string itself ("GSMG.io: part of the cipher"), and the prize address as a
string ("GSMG.io: do you beleive me you need it?"). Two more, both messaged "Good
job, Neo!" on 2020-04-03, use the raw 24 bytes of `gsmg.io/theseedisplanted`,
zero-padded on the left, and the same 192 bits reversed, which is the early hint
"esrever" applied to the image's binary code. One address, funded on 2020-04-07 with
no message, `1NULY7DhzuNvSDtPkFzNo6oRTZQWBqXNE9`
([explorer](https://mempool.space/address/1NULY7DhzuNvSDtPkFzNo6oRTZQWBqXNE9)), has
no known preimage; the creator named it in December 2020 as one of the two addresses
to check findings against instead of hitting the server, and a year later called the
door it stands for "still a thing" (Telegram, reported). I read it as the third door.

`data/planted-addresses.csv` lists the addresses, messages and preimages; I
re-derived every listed preimage on 2026-09-03. The consequence is an oracle the
community had the list for since 2020 and never used as one: any candidate answer for
any stage is testable offline, exactly, by hashing it (or padding its raw bytes, or
reversing its bits) into a key and comparing the compressed and uncompressed P2PKH
addresses to the list. The prize address itself is the uncompressed form of its key,
and the creator's transaction of 2021-07-18, `OP_RETURN` "GSMG.io neighbors, half
and double", pays exactly the uncompressed addresses of 2P, P/2, P+G and P-G, P being
the prize public key; the community had read those neighbours since 2021, the exact
check is mine. The second address is none of those neighbours, in either form.

### Established facts

1. `1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe` was first funded with exactly 5 BTC on
   2019-04-13 and holds 1.25635374 BTC as of 2026-09-03 (checked via
   [mempool.space](https://mempool.space)); it has 126 transactions, of which 2 are
   spends, both by the creator.
2. Those 2 spends are the halvings of the prize: 2.5 BTC in block 630,001
   (2020-05-11, locktime 629,998) and 1.25 BTC on 2024-04-24 (locktime 840,003), each
   to `17ucy1K9ZUAaoY6JVtM932W9jUp5LXfyHa`, with the rest returned as change. The 2020
   split spends, as its third input, a 700-satoshi output of an `OP_RETURN` reading
   `Halving` sent from the creator's vanity address in the same block.
3. `17ucy1K9ZUAaoY6JVtM932W9jUp5LXfyHa` holds 3.75055856 BTC as of 2026-09-03 and has
   never spent; its balance is the two halvings plus third-party dust. The halving
   rule was announced by the creator in April 2019 (issue #15, Y0lan; community
   repository README). No published mechanism pays this balance to a solver.
4. The final page's body is 1075 single-character tokens (confirmed by direct
   extraction and byte count from an archived capture of the page).
5. The Bifid decoding of the 570-character segment (keyed square `DBIFHCEG`,
   period 570) reproduces byte for byte and starts with the plaintext `BTCSEED`.
6. The odd-position stream of that decoding, with I and O removed, is exactly 256
   characters over a 23-letter alphabet; of the 7 letter-pairs that could be
   removed from the 285-letter stream to reach exactly 256 symbols, only the I/O
   pair leaves a Base58-valid alphabet.
7. The 14x14 image, read as described above, spells `gsmg.io/theseedisplanted`
   exactly, with no residual bits.
8. The final page's HTML markup carries no additional hidden channel beyond the
   1075 tokens, the image, and the two text blocks (checked directly).
9. The creator's own convention is written on the archived Phase 2 and Phase 3
   page: AES-256-CBC, base64, password = SHA-256 of the answer; parts 1 to 7 hashed
   with SHA-256 give the next password. The chain from the image to the 91-letter
   phrase replays from archived material with that convention.
10. The Architect's monologue belongs to the phase 3.2 plaintext, not to the final
    page, which has not changed in substance between 2023-06 and 2026-04 (six
    captures). The base64 of its blob is wrapped at 64 columns, which is why the
    page encodes a line break ("enter") between the two halves.
11. Eight planted addresses have a verified preimage (six SHA-256 of a stage
    answer, one raw URL, one bit-reversed URL); the ninth, funded 2020-04-07 without
    a message, has none (`data/planted-addresses.csv`).
12. The prize address is the uncompressed form of its public key P, and the
    creator's 2021-07-18 "neighbors, half and double" transaction pays the
    uncompressed addresses of 2P, P/2, P+G and P-G exactly; the second address is
    none of 2P, P/2, P+G, P-G, 3P, 4P, P/4 in either form.
13. The community's "decrypted Cosmic Duality" is a padding accident, not a
    decryption: see `analysis/tested.md` section 14b. The large blob remains closed.

    decryption: see `analysis/tested.md` section 14b. The large blob remains closed.
14. The Bifid output's even-position stream is an authored four-letter channel: 285
   symbols drawn only from B, C, D and E (counts 54, 90, 72, 69), with no public or
   private account of its encoding. The odd-position stream is the 256-symbol object;
   the 29 letters dropped from it are all I and O, in the order
   `OOIIOOOIIOOIOIIOIOOOOIOIIOIOI` (reproduced on the archived capture,
   2026-08-23; see `analysis/tested.md` section 14).
15. Ten 32-hex-character gsmg.io slugs exist beyond SalPhaseIon. Three have sha256
    preimages recovered from the puzzle's own vocabulary:
    `ourfirsthintisyourlastcommand`, `hopeisthequintessentialhumandelusion`, and
    `anstoo` (the token stream's final phrase). Seven are open, listed in
    `analysis/tested.md` section 15.
11. Eight planted addresses have a verified preimage (six SHA-256 of a stage
    answer, one raw URL, one bit-reversed URL); the ninth, funded 2020-04-07 without
    a message, has none (`data/planted-addresses.csv`).
12. The prize address is the uncompressed form of its public key P, and the
    creator's 2021-07-18 "neighbors, half and double" transaction pays the
    uncompressed addresses of 2P, P/2, P+G and P-G exactly; the second address is
    none of 2P, P/2, P+G, P-G, 3P, 4P, P/4 in either form.

small-blob passwords on 2026-08-19; and 62,647,937 candidates on 2026-09-01 and
2026-09-02 across the two locks and the planted addresses, all negative with
witnesses. A `rockyou.txt` pass (14,344,391 words) on both locks and the third door
was still running when that session closed and is not reported. Full scope and
method notes for each row are in `analysis/tested.md`.

## Open leads, ranked

1. **The third door: the preimage of the unmessaged planted address of 2020-04-07**
   (an insight, then seconds). `1NULY7DhzuNvSDtPkFzNo6oRTZQWBqXNE9` is an exact,
   free, offline oracle at about 176,000 keys/s on one core, and everything textual
   is negative under all six key constructions: the puzzle's vocabulary, the system
   dictionary, short word windows of every text and of the three films, the image's
   text and numbers, the 8 image texts, every page hashed, the phase 2.1 riddle. What
   would open it is a rule the creator gave between the January 2020 poem and the
   April 2020 audio hint ("Yellow has a number and so does Blue", "primes", "zeroed
   out"), read on a non-textual object; or, when noise is acceptable, a GPU
   brainwallet pass over large dictionaries (SHA-256 construction) and a CPU pass for
   the raw construction (at most 32 bytes). Confirmed by an address match; killed
   family by family.
2. **Every password against both 80-byte locks, with extended readings** (seconds
   per family). The phase 3.2.2 blob (2019) and the SalPhaseIon blob (2021) have the
   same shape; "the private keys belong to half and better half" precedes the first,
   "yinyang" is announced after the second, and the creator manipulates 2P and P/2
   on the prize key. Every plaintext with valid padding is now read 40 ways (as is,
   reversed, bit-reversed, doubled, halved, plus or minus one modulo n) before the
   oracle. Confirmed by either lock opening; the families tested so far are in the
   table above.
3. **Replay the dynamically-constructed candidates a filter bug never reached**
   (hours to days). A 2026-07-28 review found that an appearance-based
   acceptance filter had silently rejected the correct answer shape in 98 of
   213 historical scripts. A first replay resubmitted 116,043 literal strings
   from those scripts directly (0 match), but the same scripts also built
   candidates dynamically (concatenations, permutations, chained transforms)
   that this first replay does not reach. Now to be replayed against both
   locks and the third door. Confirmed by re-running a script's own
   generation logic and finding a match; killed, stage by stage, by
   exhausting that logic with none.

4. **Decode the even-position stream of the Bifid output** (hours of reasoning).
   The reconstruction on the archived capture exposes 285 symbols drawn from only
   four letters (B, C, D, E) carrying every even slot of the output: an authored
   channel with no public account, either a second message, a key or mask for the
   256-symbol object, or the author's unfound "second way". Confirmed by any
   encoding that yields a legible string or an address match; killed by exhausting
   four-symbol encodings at length 285 (which factors 3 x 5 x 19).
5. **Determine whether the 256-symbol object is the right target at all** (an
   afternoon of reasoning, not a sweep). Every negative in row 1 to row 5 of the
   tested table assumes the key comes directly from this object; the AES-blob route
   this folder's oracle implements is a different, untested-at-scale hypothesis.
   Confirmed by a reduction, other than the ones tried, that matches an address;
   redirected by establishing the AES-blob or "Dualite" route is the real one.
6. **Identify the single tool reportedly used to build every phase** (hours). An
   authenticated author statement says one tool built every phase; comparing
   confirmed cipher conventions against one specific public tool's source code
   matches on non-obvious details (no period parameter on its Bifid cipher, a short
   menu of available ciphers). Confirmed by a cipher from that tool's menu
   producing a match on the "Dualite" password or the 256-object reduction; killed
   by exhausting that tool's short menu with no match.
7. **Follow "esrever" on the remaining objects** (minutes to hours). The hint is
   now explained for the object it was paired with: the bit-reversed image URL is
   the second "Good job, Neo!" key. It has not been applied to the two locks'
   plaintexts beyond the extended readings above, nor to the 256-symbol object.
8. **Use the 29 dropped bits somewhere** (minutes per reading). The drop sequence
   `OOIIOOOIIOOIOIIOIOOOOIOIIOIOI` is all I and O, so binary or nothing; standalone
   readings are exhausted with no legible fragment, so the open question is what
   they select or gate, plausibly in combination with the even stream of lead 3.
9. **Read the 29 dropped letters as their own message** (minutes). Reducing the
   285-letter stream to the 256-symbol object drops exactly 29 letters, never read
   as an object in their own right. Confirmed by a match or a legible fragment;
   killed by exhausting the small set of reasonable reading orders.
10. **Preimage the seven remaining hash-slug routes** (minutes per batch). Three of
   ten fell to sha256 over the puzzle's own phrases in one evening; each newly
   transcribed stage wording is another candidate batch. Confirmed by a preimage
   whose page carries content.
