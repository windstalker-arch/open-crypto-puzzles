# Trithemius: Wealth in Poetry (0.0312463 BTC, [OPEN])

Writing under the pseudonym "Trithemius," the author published an article on Medium/Coinmonks in
2019 titled "Securing Bitcoin Seed Phrases in Stories," teaching a method for hiding a 12-word
BIP39 seed inside an ordinary narrative: a numeric key, specific to the author, picks word
positions out of the story text. The article demonstrates the method with two fully worked
examples and closes by stating that the reader has, by finishing the article, read every word
needed to recover a wallet holding 0.03 BTC. I calibrated the only certain part of the mechanism,
the tokenization rule, against both worked examples, then ran roughly 900,000 derivations across
three large campaigns covering numeric keys, derivation families, and passphrases. All are
negative. The escrow remains unclaimed seven years on, and the real carrier text and numeric key,
by the author's own design, are not guessable from the article alone.

## The puzzle as published

The article (archived locally, byte-identical to a third-party mirror,
[medium.com/coinmonks](https://medium.com/coinmonks/securing-bitcoin-seed-phrases-in-stories-d8eb43a02254),
2019-02-11) opens with a story about the author's grandfather smuggling gold while fleeing China,
then teaches "trithemian seeds." It demonstrates two encoding methods, each with its own story and
seed: a phone number whose digits give word positions in a courtship story, and a formula
`position[i] = i*10 + digit[i]` applied to the concatenated digits of a location's latitude and
longitude, run against a story about a letter to a court. The article closes: "The beauty of
trithemian seeds is that they hide in plain sight. If you've read this far, you've read every
word required to access a wallet with .03 BTC. Good luck!" and "Only you know which story
contains your wealth."

## What is understood

### Mechanism

The chain is: article text, tokenized into words, then a numeric key (unknown, author-specific)
selects 12 word positions, giving a candidate 12-word phrase to run through BIP39 and every
standard derivation path. Tokenization is the one calibrated link: of 4 tokenizers tried, exactly
2 reproduce the word positions of both published worked examples exactly, which is why those two
are treated as certain rather than assumed.

### Derivation and oracle

This folder ships a certified oracle, `tools/oracle.py`, covering the old-Electrum (non-BIP39)
V1 and V2 derivation paths. It passes `--selftest`: for two known-good Electrum V1 and V2 vectors
it re-derives the seed, the m/0/0 P2PKH address, and the m/0/0 child xprv across two independent
implementations and prints `SELFTEST OK`. A candidate is checked the same way a solver would:
derive the P2PKH address (compressed and
uncompressed) for a 12-word candidate under BIP44/49/84 and any raw BIP32 path in scope, and
compare it, byte for byte, to the escrow address at
[mempool.space](https://mempool.space/address/1K4ezpLybootYF23TM4a8Y4NyP7auysnRo).

### Established facts

1. Tokenization is calibrated: 2 of 4 tested tokenizers reproduce the exact word positions of
   both of the author's published examples.
2. The article's own GPS-formula example, applied to the full narrative rather than just the
   demonstration letter, leaves 2 of the 12 word slots with zero valid BIP39 options, which
   confirms that published example is a worked demonstration, not the real wallet key.
3. A stylometric pass (surprisal and substitution scoring across the full narrative) found BIP39
   words statistically indistinguishable from the rest of the text, meaning there is no detectable
   insertion fingerprint marking which words are the real seed.
4. Forensic analysis of the archived article file (33 MIME parts, every embedded image at full
   resolution) found no appended data, no hidden metadata, and no zero-width characters.

## What has been tested

Full ledger in [analysis/tested.md](analysis/tested.md). Every negative below is marked
uncertified: no known-good acceptance vector has been built for the derivation code, so under
this repository's own convention these counts describe search coverage, not proven exhaustion.

| Hypothesis | Space | Method | Result | Witness | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Numeric-key enumeration: coordinate formats, landmarks, in-article numbers, phone/GPS/cumulative methods, multiple carriers | 541 keys, about 300,000 derivations | address comparison, compressed and uncompressed | 0 match | uncertified | 2026-08-02 |
| Derivation-family sweep on the 4 clean example seeds: BIP44/49/84 multi-account, raw BIP32 paths, master key, old Electrum v1/v2 | about 500,000 addresses derived | address comparison | 0 match | uncertified | 2026-08-02 |
| Passphrase (25th word) sweep on the 4 clean seeds: curated article-derived terms, full-phrase candidates, brute-force wordlists | about 78,000 derivations | address comparison | 0 match | uncertified | 2026-08-02 |
| Image steganography: full-resolution originals, LSB analysis on lossless formats | 11 images | bit-plane analysis | pure noise (bit ratio about 0.5), 0 WIF or hex64 strings recovered | uncertified | 2026-08-02 |
| Direct WIF/hex scan of the raw article file | 125 base58-like substrings | BIP38/WIF checksum check | 0 pass the checksum (all image data false positives) | uncertified | 2026-08-02 |

## Open leads, ranked

1. **[CLOSED 2026-08-31] Read the cipher table on the embedded Steganographia photo.** The embedded
   image is the 1606 Frankfurt title page of Steganographia (Jesus College M.7.7), used as a
   references-section citation matching the bibliography entry "Steganographia. Frankfurt, 1606."
   Full-res OCR reads only the title panel, author line, clavis note, and imprint (MDCVI); there is
   no numeric cipher table printed on the photographed page. See analysis/leads.md for the verified
   evidence.
2. **[CLOSED 2026-08-31] Rule out an old-Electrum (non-BIP39) wallet** (hours). A certified
   `tools/oracle.py --selftest` re-derives seed, m/0/0 P2PKH address, and m/0/0 child xprv for both
   Electrum V1 and V2 across two independent implementations and prints `SELFTEST OK`. The four
   clean example seeds run through the certified oracle give 0 match (PHONE/GPS/abandon are not
   even valid Electrum mnemonics; the broken WITCH demo is valid but misses the escrow). The
   Electrum derivation path is now proven to accept a correct candidate, so an Electrum-format
   answer, were one ever found, would be caught. See analysis/leads.md and analysis/tested.md.
3. **[CLOSED 2026-08-31] Build a certified acceptance test for the derivation code.** The
   derivation runs through the central `tools/derive.py`; it now has a `--selftest` command that
   re-derives four known-good BIP39 seed-and-address vectors end to end (bip44/49/84/eth for the
   standard `abandon ... about` test mnemonic) and prints `SELFTEST OK`. A passing run proves the
   BIP39-mnemonic -> seed -> BIP32/44/49/84 -> address pipeline accepts a correct candidate, so
   the address-comparison negatives in analysis/tested.md are now certified on the derivation math
   (they still only bound numeric-key / carrier search coverage, not the author-specific words).
