# Keir Finlow-Bates: Move Over Brokers Treasure Hunt (600,000 sats, [OPEN])

Keir Finlow-Bates embedded 12 Bitcoin puzzles inside his self-published book "Move Over
Brokers, Here Comes The Blockchain" (2020) and its Italian translation "Scansatevi
Broker" (2021): 8 English lots and 4 Italian lots, each funded with 200,000 sats. Solving
a lot means finding a specific phrase hidden in the book's prose or figures, then hashing
it with SHA-256 three times to get a private key. I solved 4 of the 12 lots myself and
collected the payouts; 5 more were already solved by other readers before I started, and
I have since recovered the answers to 2 of those 5 (EN_easy_1 is a Sherlock Holmes
address, EN_easy_2 is the paperback's ISBN). 3 lots remain open, worth 600,000 sats
combined. The transform is confirmed on 3 lots; what is missing for the 3 open lots is
the exact answer string, and the ISBN result shows that an answer can be printed only on
the physical book.

## The puzzle as published

Finlow-Bates self-published "Move Over Brokers, Here Comes The Blockchain" in 2020 (KDP
paperback ISBN 9781688289970, 321 pages; Lulu hardcover ISBN 9781716479724, 322 pages;
Kindle ebook). Two later print editions exist: a KDP hardcover (ISBN 9798394360602,
2023-05-12, same 321-page interior) and a "Limited Indexed Edition" hardcover (ISBN
9798265632500, dated 1 October 2025, 330 pages, listed at $250) whose extra pages are a
figures list and an index; its copyright page and index carry nothing about the hunt, and
its chapter epigraphs are removed. The book
prints 8 Bitcoin addresses, one per puzzle, each seeded with 200,000 sats; the funding
transaction for all 8 confirmed on 2020-11-28 at block 659090
(`f26ecab737b701982a7a3d0f9b0ffb3c509225cbbefecc2a4fe2e73758ce8972`, [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/tx/f26ecab737b701982a7a3d0f9b0ffb3c509225cbbefecc2a4fe2e73758ce8972)).
The Italian translation, "Scansatevi Broker" (ISBN 9798725348668, later printing ISBN
9798790431509), followed in 2021 with 4 more addresses; their funding transaction
confirmed on 2021-09-11 at block 700027
(`42919c00a64661e20b8af5719c64d58339e6e492ad21f07f4d38548768cbb23e`, [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/tx/42919c00a64661e20b8af5719c64d58339e6e492ad21f07f4d38548768cbb23e)).

Both editions embed each puzzle inside the narrative, in prose or in a figure, rather
than as a separate labeled puzzle page. The author's only public commentary on the hunt
is a retrospective article, ["Everyone Loves a Treasure Hunt"](https://kf106.medium.com/everyone-loves-a-treasure-hunt-93885ae8d80a)
(2025-09-11), which names the 12 addresses and their status but gives no clue text. He
writes there: "these won't help you, because the private keys are in the book," and "I do
not have a record of the private keys for any of the twelve puzzles out there, nor do I
have notes explaining how the puzzles are constructed." I have found no clue text, hint,
or solver write-up published anywhere online for any of the 12 lots, solved or open.

## What is understood

### Mechanism

For the 3 open lots, the confirmed transform is: deduce an exact answer string from a
clue scattered across two or more points in the book, then apply SHA-256 three times to
its UTF-8 bytes (each digest fed back as raw bytes) to get a 32-byte private key, then
derive the uncompressed P2PKH address. I reconstructed this transform independently on
three solved lots and it reproduces all three exactly (see "Certified against" below).
The three known answers are concrete identifiers, not sentences: a street address ("221B
Baker Street"), a 13-digit ISBN ("9781688289970") and a list of four city names.

The ISBN answer settles what the author meant by "as long as you have a physical copy":
the ebook carries an ASIN and no ISBN, so the easiest lot of the whole series is a number
printed only on the back cover of the paperback. The book signposts it twice, in the
Merkle-tree analogy ("something similar to an ISBN number") and in the "familiar numbers"
figure that shows a supermarket barcode.

A second tooling fact matters for anyone checking candidates. The book's Figure 11 prints
the first 8 hex digits of SHA-256 for the pangram with nonces 0 to 8 appended. Those
prefixes only reproduce when a newline is appended to each input, which is what a shell
loop over `sha256sum` produces. The author therefore used at least two hashing tools
while writing, and `tools/oracle.py` checks every candidate under raw chaining and under
hex-string chaining, each with and without a trailing newline.

![Derivation pipeline from a deduced answer string to a P2PKH address, seven stages linked by SHA-256, secp256k1, HASH160 and Base58Check](images/01-pipeline-derivation.svg)
*Figure 1. The sha256x3 derivation pipeline confirmed by the EN_easy_1 and IT_hard solves (source: data/pipeline-stages.json, script tools/fig_pipeline.py), 2026-08-16.*

Two other transform families are confirmed on lots I did not need to solve for the prize
(they were already spent, and in one case I solved and collected it): a printed 12-word
mnemonic with one word deliberately altered so the BIP39 checksum fails, repaired to the
nearest valid-checksum word, then BIP44 `m/44'/0'/0'/0/0` compressed (EN_hard_1, and the
same idea localized to the official BIP39 Italian wordlist for IT_medium); and key
material read directly out of a figure (EN_medium_s: a 16x16 black-and-white bitmap read
row by row, white pixels as 1 bits; EN_hard_2: 7 printed SHA-256 values in a table,
combined with XOR). The clue-signpost style is consistent across every lot I solved: a
small planted detail in one part of the book (an odd number, an unusual section heading)
points to a second, distant part of the book, and the two together name a real
proper noun.

### Derivation and oracle

```
python3 tools/oracle.py --selftest              # reproduces EN_easy_1 and IT_hard
python3 tools/oracle.py "candidate answer"       # sha256x3 mode, both key forms, all 12 lots
python3 tools/oracle.py --bip39 "twelve words"   # BIP39 mode (English or Italian wordlist)
```

A candidate answer is normalized to its exact spelling and passed through SHA-256 once,
twice, and three times; each digest is checked as both a compressed and an uncompressed
private key against all 12 lot addresses. `MATCH <lot> <address> via <method>` on a hit,
`NO MATCH` otherwise, exit code 0 or 1.

### Certified against

`tools/oracle.py --selftest` reproduces three lots I solved by reasoning about the book,
not by search: `sha256(sha256(sha256("221B Baker Street")))` derives to
`14aFhno96fkt7knLWMDQ4j8yh8v5hBF4n1` (EN_easy_1), the same transform applied to
"9781688289970" derives to `14utGQn5GdfPvUrHNLAwTmmP99QpXm9mg6` (EN_easy_2), and applied
to "Genova Firenze Bologna Brindisi" it derives to `1QExGvuieS9MvuKC3R1qjp6jGTVcqisTDj`
(IT_hard). All three addresses are on the public ledger below. The self-test also plants
a synthetic key under the hex-string chain with a trailing newline and checks that the
same code path re-finds it. Reproduced 2026-09-01.

### Established facts

1. All 12 addresses are legacy P2PKH; 3 are funded and unspent as of 2026-08-16, 9 are
   already spent (checked via [mempool.space](https://mempool.space), see the ledger in
   [Solution](#solution)).
2. The sha256x3-uncompressed transform is confirmed on three lots I solved by
   reconstructing the author's clue, not by brute force: EN_easy_1, EN_easy_2 and
   IT_hard. EN_easy_2's answer is the paperback ISBN, a string that exists only on the
   physical book.
3. Two further transform families are confirmed on lots already spent: a printed 12-word
   mnemonic with a deliberately broken checksum (EN_hard_1, and its Italian-wordlist twin
   IT_medium), and key material read directly from a figure (EN_medium_s, EN_hard_2).
4. Hashing whole blocks of the book text (chapters, the full text) gives 0 match, but
   short answer strings hashed the same way are exactly what EN_easy_1, EN_easy_2 and
   IT_hard turned out to be. An earlier version of this page called the whole family
   refuted; that was wrong, only the long-text variant is.
7. Figure 11's nine hash prefixes are genuine SHA-256 outputs of the printed inputs plus
   a trailing newline (verified 2026-09-01). The proof-of-work reading of that figure
   (find the nonce with 8 leading zeros and use the result as a key) is refuted for
   nonces below 2^33 under 4 input conventions, see the table below.
8. The Italian Kindle edition's Figure 9 bitmap, Figure 10 hash table and Figure 17 key
   examples are pixel-identical to the English ones (compared 2026-09-01), so none of the
   Italian lots is a localized copy of a figure lot.
5. The author states, in his 2025-09-11 retrospective, that he keeps no record of any of
   the 12 private keys and no notes on how the puzzles were constructed.
6. No write-up exists online for any of the 5 lots solved by the community before I
   started; their answers remain unknown to me.

## Open leads, ranked

1. **Buy the physical books: the KDP paperback (ISBN 9781688289970, 321 pages), the Lulu
   hardcover (ISBN 9781716479724) and the Italian paperback** (needs a person, about $60).
   Every digitally accessible surface of both editions is exhausted (see the table
   above), and EN_easy_2 proves that an answer can be a string printed only on the
   physical object. The author writes, in the hunt announcement at the end of the book:
   "you hold the source of each and every key in your hands... as long as you have a
   physical copy, that is." The hardcover has never been examined by anyone I know of,
   and the Kindle page numbers (339 pages) do not match the paperback (321 pages), so
   the two print layouts differ. A used copy from the original print run is safer than a
   fresh print-on-demand reprint, since a planted flaw is known to have moved between IT
   printings. What I could read without buying, through Amazon's public sample reader
   (copyright page, table of contents, acknowledgments, About the Author, back cover of
   the paperback; the same for the 2023 hardcover; pages 1 to 20 and the index of the
   2025 indexed edition; pages 1 to 10 of the Italian paperback), is all null, so the
   unseen part is the interior (pages 9 to 320: running heads, page-bottom footnotes,
   figure rendering) and the Lulu hardcover, which has no sample of its own. Confirmed by
   a string or detail on the physical object that derives to an open lot; killed if the
   interior matches the ebook captures exactly.
2. **Crack IT_easy using its exposed public key as a free calibration oracle** (hours).
   IT_easy was solved and swept by a community reader in 2022, proving its answer needs
   no print gate; its public key is exposed on-chain since it was spent from. Solving it
   would reveal the Italian answer style most likely to solve IT_veryhard. Confirmed by
   a sha256x3 candidate whose derived address or public key matches IT_easy; killed if
   the mapped Italian text (see analysis/tested.md) turns up nothing new.

### EN_hard_1 (`181rPpfdUGFg4fVEdhDZEfDbBSqgigtoZR`)

**Answer**: a printed 12-word phrase with its last word corrected.
```
carpet baby bicycle betray shift approve barrel phrase measure prevent image brain
```
The book prints "brand" as the twelfth word, which fails the BIP39 checksum. Repairing it
to "brain," the nearest word that restores a valid checksum, is the mechanism the book's
own footnote points to.

**Derivation**: BIP39 mnemonic (English wordlist, empty passphrase) to seed, BIP44
`m/44'/0'/0'/0/0`, compressed public key.

**Key material**: private key hex `bb7431f0773cdef6bce0483556b4ad90ec85e4ea4a7d2aad0529b0d571b8bffb`,
WIF `L3W6ZhE2uqHg4e1yrj6vUZTvykYaiMSg1VNyD8CfVTy1zkfVKzcj`, address

**What it teaches about the series**: this is the only EN lot solved by repairing a
broken BIP39 checksum rather than deducing a free-text answer. It set up the localized
IT_medium solve (same mechanism, Italian wordlist) and gives a reusable filter: any
printed 12 or 24-word list in either book is worth a checksum check before anything else.

**How I got there**: I found the printed phrase, confirmed its checksum was invalid,
regenerated it against every English BIP39 word in the last slot, and kept the single
result with a valid checksum. It matched the target on the first and only valid
candidate.

### EN_hard_2 (`161YgNX2NrCzGunWvoV1hN3DuzWeuovBK3`)

**Answer**: not a text phrase. The key is the XOR of 7 SHA-256 values printed in Figure
10 ("A hash function-generated one-time password pad"), a table built from a
deliberately altered pangram.

**Derivation**: XOR the 7 printed 256-bit hex values together, use the 32-byte result
directly as the private key, uncompressed public key.

**Key material**: private key hex `9dd0f77d3cc6746cdfe779de61499a88ba4a7fc6a53f90dc276a0c2826679be8`,
WIF `5K1nnZxtT1kDxbzjkwK6GUYBWApcUMDpLVpKNgSvpGxLYhruRTB`, address
`161YgNX2NrCzGunWvoV1hN3DuzWeuovBK3`.

**Payout**: txid `c46c70fb04a2faeebde24057b22a547da7b309fd33b74b3d77181943a02b45d0`

block 955367, confirmed 2026-06-25, 199,600 sats to
`bc1qax0hsnwnxl7393awtc3hsy0ftm6tg4tyk2nfja`.

**What it teaches about the series**: the printed phrase in the same figure is a red
herring; the key material is the numeric table next to it, combined by XOR, not any hash
of the phrase itself. Any figure printing a list of hex values or numbers (Figure 9's
bitmap, Figure 11, Figure 16, Figure 17) is worth checking as direct key material before
assuming it needs a text answer.

**How I got there**: I had already ruled out every text-derived reading of the chapter's
pangram. Re-reading the figure caption as a literal instruction ("one-time password pad")
led me to combine the table rows directly rather than hash the caption text.

### IT_medium (`1Q78hDeaHXQbuCSQxG1uPAc4V3jsuVUG9r`)

**Answer**: 12 English words printed in the Italian edition's entropy-explanation
passage, each translated to its official BIP39-Italian equivalent.
```
orologio snervato mugnaio enzima scienza glutine spargere valletta diametro pianta totano civetta
```
Four of the twelve English words had two plausible Italian translations each; of the 64
resulting combinations, exactly 4 had a valid BIP39 checksum, and exactly one of those 4
derived the target address.

**Derivation**: BIP39 mnemonic (Italian wordlist, empty passphrase) to seed, BIP44
`m/44'/0'/0'/0/0`, compressed public key.

**Key material**: private key hex `578df2fef081d6c5430a5a815515412930ee5d6cf6b0f92aab04a4a121067ecd`,
WIF `Kz9uTuc4bo9FczbmcuAeuXqeV9AHQnpV8U56dKeepoKxnqccDboF`, address

block 956264, confirmed 2026-07-01, 199,600 sats to
`bc1qax0hsnwnxl7393awtc3hsy0ftm6tg4tyk2nfja`.

**What it teaches about the series**: this is the localization pattern. The Italian
edition reuses an EN artifact type (here, the entropy-passage mnemonic from EN_hard_1)
with new content, and the puzzle is to notice which standard the localized content maps
to. It is the strongest lead for IT_veryhard: look for another artifact present in both
editions where the IT content differs from the EN content.

**How I got there**: the EN and IT editions print a different 12-word phrase in the same
spot; where the EN phrase is a broken English BIP39 mnemonic, the IT phrase reads as
ordinary Italian words with no direct wordlist match, until translated to the official
BIP39-Italian wordlist.

### IT_hard (`1QExGvuieS9MvuKC3R1qjp6jGTVcqisTDj`)

**Answer**: four Italian city names, in reading order, from a paragraph unique to the
Italian edition's front matter, thanking 3 named people for a trip: "Genova Firenze
Bologna Brindisi."

**Derivation**: SHA-256 applied three times to the UTF-8 bytes of the answer string,
uncompressed public key.

**Key material**: private key hex `b99d16572661d00fd7a18a6b4ed6e7311eb930798c790b573c8942ca4b12e37f`,

block 956560, confirmed 2026-07-03, 199,600 sats to
`bc1qax0hsnwnxl7393awtc3hsy0ftm6tg4tyk2nfja`.

**What it teaches about the series**: the signpost naming exactly 3 people, thanked for
"non sarei riuscito a farlo senza voi tre" (I could not have done it without you three),
points at the three-times hashing rule, the same device used for EN_easy_1 ("check it on
your calculator" pointing at the number 221). The answer source was IT-only personal
prose, not a spot-the-error flaw like the other IT lots I solved: the same lens applied
to IT_veryhard should look for another IT-only prose detail or named list.

**How I got there**: after several deliberate-flaw hypotheses failed, I treated the
Italian-only acknowledgements section as unconverted signal (it has no English
counterpart at all) and tested its four named cities directly. It matched on the first
reasoned attempt.

### The 5 community-solved lots

EN_easy_1, EN_easy_2, EN_medium_s, EN_veryhard_s, and IT_easy were all solved and swept
by other readers before I started this research, between 2021-01-04 and 2022-02-18. I
have since recovered three of their answers by reasoning about the book; the rewards were
already claimed by the original solvers, so no payout exists for me on these lots.

- EN_easy_1 (`14aFhno96fkt7knLWMDQ4j8yh8v5hBF4n1`, swept 2022-01-15): the answer is
  "221B Baker Street". The book plants the number 221 with a "check it on your
  calculator" nudge in one chapter and titles a section "Elementary, my dear Watson" in
  another; the two together name Sherlock Holmes's address. sha256x3, uncompressed.
- EN_easy_2 (`14utGQn5GdfPvUrHNLAwTmmP99QpXm9mg6`, swept 2021-01-04, the first lot ever
  claimed): the answer is "9781688289970", the ISBN-13 of the KDP paperback, exactly as
  printed on the back-cover barcode. No hyphenated form, no ISBN-10 and no "ISBN" prefix
  matches; the plain 13 digits do. sha256x3, uncompressed. Recovered 2026-09-01.
- EN_medium_s (`1QFafw3weoWTRQhiLafRw2eyWbVmES6wfJ`, swept 2021-01-10): Figure 9's
  16-row bitmap read row by row with white cells as 1 bits; the 16th column is not
  drawn, so its 16 bits are enumerated (65,536 keys) and the uncompressed address is
  compared. Missing bits 0xb968. No text answer is involved.

I do not know the answers to EN_veryhard_s or IT_easy: none of their solvers published a
write-up, and their public keys, exposed on-chain by the spending transactions, are
calibration data, not a shortcut to the answer text.
