# Corey Phillips: Kitten Passphrase Puzzle (0.01 BTC, [OPEN])

Corey Phillips, a Bitcoin developer, published this puzzle in 2019: a photo of a kitten
whose bytes deterministically produce a fixed, public 24-word BIP39 mnemonic, and a
0.01 BTC address generated from that mnemonic plus a secret passphrase. The mnemonic and
the derivation are fully reproducible from the published image; the only unknown is the
passphrase, the "25th word." I have tested about 1.16 billion candidates across curated,
rule-mangled, and raw wordlist regions, with 0 matches, and confirmed the image carries
no hidden data beyond its role as the entropy source. The prize remains unclaimed; what
is missing is the passphrase itself.

## The puzzle as published

Corey Phillips posted the puzzle image, `kitten.jpeg`, in a 2019-07-09 Medium article
demonstrating his "bitimage" method for turning any file into a Bitcoin key. In his own
words: "To prove the viability of this method, I have also sent 0.01 BTC to the following
address, `bc1qcyrndzgy036f6ax370g8zyvlw86ulawgt0246r`. This address was generated using
the kitten image along with a BIP39 passphrase. Remember, this is not meant to be solved.
It is meant to prove the viability of this method, but if you somehow manage to claim it,
congrats!" He adds that the same image, with an empty passphrase, sits behind a second
"sister" address holding a smaller amount: "The mnemonic for the kitten photo without a
passphrase contains roughly 0.00095133 BTC. Feel free to claim it if you manage to sweep
the keys in time."

A community-maintained hint repository mirrors this write-up ("This repository contains
all publicly known hints for BTC Puzzle by Corey Phillips challenge. Contributions are
welcome!") and adds the mechanism in plain terms (base64 the image, SHA-256 the result,
feed the digest to BIP39's `entropyToMnemonic`) plus 3 hints: working Python code to
derive keys from the image, a brute-force script over a `wordlists` folder, and a
suggestion to check the image for steganography with named public tools. The author
separately published a related "Bitcoin Audio Puzzle" (2020-01-05) in the same format
family (a 24-word seed on BIP84), which I decoded independently; it carries no passphrase
for this puzzle. No "Part 3" of his puzzle article series was ever published.

## What is understood

### Mechanism

![Derivation pipeline from the kitten image to a P2WPKH address, with the passphrase marked as the only unknown](images/01-pipeline-derivation.svg)
*Figure 1. The image-to-address pipeline; the passphrase (orange box) is the only unknown input (source: data/pipeline-stages.json, script tools/fig_pipeline.py), 2026-08-16.*

The chain is: `kitten.jpeg` to base64 to SHA-256 to BIP39 `entropyToMnemonic` (24 words,
fixed) to seed (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 over the mnemonic, salted with "mnemonic" plus the
passphrase, 2048 rounds) to BIP32 `m/84'/0'/0'/0/0` to a compressed public key to a
bech32 P2WPKH address. The 24-word mnemonic is entirely determined by the published
image and requires no guessing:
```
blossom educate state course sick fresh color divide number soap please pull glide weather join grit depart dynamic tenant leopard alter piano slight room
```
The only unknown in the whole chain is the BIP39 passphrase.

### Derivation and oracle

```
python3 tools/oracle.py --selftest              # reproduces the sister address
python3 tools/oracle.py "<candidate passphrase>" # MATCH or NO MATCH
python3 tools/oracle.py --stdin                  # one candidate per line
```

A candidate is used exactly as given (passphrases are case- and space-sensitive) and
pushed through the full derivation above; a match means the resulting bech32 address
equals the target byte for byte.

### Certified against

`tools/oracle.py --selftest` reproduces `sha256(base64(kitten.jpeg))` as
`1808d35318ac7cb98b69ff9779b699d6a631f15e0b353ac89b7c4020774832ed`, matching the
author's own published value exactly, and derives the empty-passphrase address as
`bc1q57euh23y3qs2f9d5mtwpax5lqecfvrdkqce82a`, the "sister" address the author names in
his own write-up. Reproduced 2026-08-16.

### Established facts

1. The image in `clues/kitten.jpeg` is byte-identical to the published puzzle image: its
   base64-then-SHA-256 digest matches the author's own quoted value exactly.
2. The 24-word mnemonic is fully determined by the image; the only unknown is the
   passphrase.
3. The image carries no hidden data beyond its role as the entropy source: exiftool shows
   clean metadata, binwalk finds only the JPEG structure, and `strings` shows only
   compression noise. Checked 2026-06-13.
4. The sister address (empty passphrase) has since been spent: it received 95,133 sats on
   2019-07-02 and was emptied the same week, on 2019-07-09; it later received an unrelated
   320,000 sats on 2024-09-22 and was emptied again the same day. It is not a target,
   only the calibration vector for the oracle. Checked 2026-08-16.
5. The author's related "Bitcoin Audio Puzzle" is fully decoded (FSK tones at 1080 and
   1260 Hz, demodulated with minimodem into a Bitcoin transaction carrying an OP_RETURN
   message describing a 24-word BIP84 seed), but the message is not a usable passphrase
   for this puzzle (tested, 0 match).
6. No "Part 3" of the author's article series exists; his Medium index lists exactly 4
   posts and nothing further.

| New curated thematic/foreign family (single-word kitten/photo/secret/key terms in 6+ languages, author/tool names, filename-style, reversed, numeric-appended, thematic two-word compounds) | 86 | CPU derivation | 0 match | yes | 2026-08-31 |

Cumulative: 1,155,064,682 + 7,893 + 86 = 1,155,428,575 candidates tested, 0 matches, across 17 families. Witness
caveat that applies to every row: a control passphrase was recovered in the same run and
independently reproduced by a second tool, but its position within each run was not
separately logged, so this is a well-instrumented negative rather than a formally
exhaustive one.

## Open leads, ranked

1. **Ask the author directly** (needs a person, otherwise free). Every public source I
   can identify is exhausted: the related audio puzzle is fully decoded, there is no
   unpublished third article, and the image carries no hidden data. Corey Phillips is
   reachable through Medium, GitHub, and his employer Synonym's public accounts, and
   explicitly invites
   solvers in his own write-up. Confirmed by any reply that narrows the passphrase;
   killed by no reply, which leaves only the bounded fallbacks below.
2. **Safety-net derivation on BIP44 and BIP49** (minutes), executed and closed 2026-08-23:
   153 rebuilt-corpus candidates x 6 paths = 918 derivations, 0 matches, witnessed against
   the public BIP84 test vector.
3. **Three-word thematic combinator** (hours). Only two-word combinations from the
   puzzle's vocabulary have been tested; a three-word extension over the same curated
   list is a bounded, not-yet-run search. Confirmed by a match; killed by a full sweep
   with 0 matches.
