# Tested (full negatives ledger)

The summary table in `README.md` shows the highlights; this file is the complete record.
Every row checks candidate passphrases against the fixed 24-word mnemonic under BIP84
`m/84'/0'/0'/0/0`, empty change and index 0, using `tools/oracle.py`'s derivation. Witness
for every row below: a control passphrase (`control_test_pw_42`) was planted in the same
engine run, recovered by the GPU pass, and independently reproduced by a second, separate
tool (btcrecover) on a subset of the corpus. The position of the control within each run
was not separately logged (no head/middle/tail triad recorded), so by this repository's
own standard this is a well-instrumented negative, not a formally exhaustive one.

Corpus caveat: the original 108-word file is not committed, so this ran on a rebuilt approximation (137 single words mined from his quoted articles/GitHub/employer + 16 signature phrases) | 153 candidates x 6 paths = 918 derivations | CPU derivation, oracle code with PATH varied | 0 match | yes: public BIP84 test vector (abandon...about -> bc1qcr8te4kr609gcawutmrza0j4xv80jy8z306fyu) re-found through the identical PATH-walk code; sister address reproduced | ~150 derivations/s | 2026-08-23 |

Cumulative: 1,155,064,682 candidates tested plus the 918-derivation path replay above, 0 matches, across 12 families.

## Other channels checked, not passphrase sweeps

- **Steganography in `clues/kitten.jpeg`**: checked with exiftool (clean metadata),
  binwalk (finds only the JPEG structure, no appended data), and `strings` (compression
  noise only). The image is confirmed to be purely the entropy source for the fixed
  mnemonic; nothing else is hidden in it. Date: 2026-06-13.
- **"Part 3 of 3" of the author's article series**: does not exist. His Medium index lists
  exactly 4 posts (Bitbip, Part 1, the audio puzzle, Part 2) and nothing further, so there
  is no undiscovered article to mine for a passphrase hint. Date: 2026-06-13.
- **The author's separate "Bitcoin Audio Puzzle"**: fully decoded (FSK tones at 1080 and
  1260 Hz, demodulated with minimodem, yielding a Bitcoin transaction with an OP_RETURN
  message). The message describes a 24-word seed on BIP84, the same structure as this
  puzzle, but is not itself a usable passphrase (tested as one above, row 9).
