# Genesis Block Wallet Puzzle (168,779 sats, [OPEN])

On 2026-08-22 an anonymous author published a 252-byte OP_RETURN message in block 963,629:
a Bitcoin wallet generated only from data in Satoshi's genesis block, "extremely low"
entropy, nothing backed up. The prize sits in the first output of that same transaction, a
P2WSH address, and it grows every time someone pays for a hint: the author answers questions
on chain and relays every payment into the escrow. Eleven author messages so far fix the
shape of the lock: a 2-of-2 multisig, both keys from one genesis field, no hash, a field you
can read in The Times, the BIP48 level order, and since 2026-09-11 the root itself: a
12-word BIP39 mnemonic whose entropy is genesis data, with a passphrase, and a genesis value
as the BIP48 account number. The oracle is exact and offline. Two passes on 2026-08-29 had
exhausted the mechanical readings of the earlier hints (611,008 keys, 5.7e11 ordered pairs,
0 match, witnesses re-found); the two September answers, obtained by a reader who sent the
exact questions drafted in this folder, re-bound the space to 128-bit windows of the genesis
block plus a passphrase.

## The puzzle as published

The author has no website, no forum thread and no handle. Everything is in OP_RETURN outputs
of transactions paid to the escrow, readable by anyone. Verbatim texts with txids are in
[clues/author-posts.md](clues/author-posts.md); the full ledger of the 18 transactions is in
[data/on-chain-dialogue.json](data/on-chain-dialogue.json).

Answers given so far, in order (the questions are in the clues file):

| Date (UTC) | Author's answer |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-23 15:43 | "The witness script is a multisig." |
| 2026-08-23 21:08 | "Two keys, both required. The rest is for you to derive." |
| 2026-08-24 07:13 | "Yes, both keys use the same Genesis field, and there is no hash." |
| 2026-08-24 14:32 | "Both keys are derived independently from Genesis." |
| 2026-08-24 21:35 | "The Genesis Block is public. Which part of it matters is for you to discover." |
| 2026-08-28 23:15 | "Solve it to find out. Maybe both. If you can't check the Genesis block, you can also use The Times newspaper!" (asked: "Prize Address? Genesis field 32 bytes or smaller?") |
| 2026-08-28 23:50 | `Derivation rule: root -> multisig -> mainnet -> genesis_data -> script_type` (asked: "Can you give any hint about derivation offset/rule?") |
| 2026-09-06 19:41 | "I can't give hints without a question. Low-value transactions get bad hints; dust will be ignored." (a player had sent 1,000 sats with "give another hint") |
| 2026-09-10 21:33 | "root = the master key derived from the BIP39 seed; genesis_data = some data from the genesis block used as the BIP48 account number." (asked, 10,000 sats: "Root = Times text as BIP32 seed? BIP39? raw key? genesis_data = BIP48 account?") |
| 2026-09-11 23:26 | "BIP39: 12 words; Passphrase: Y; Entropy: The data needed to solve it is publicly available in the genesis block." (asked, 10,000 sats: "BIP39 entropy: genesis bytes/puzzle text/img/other? words 12/24? passphrase Y/N?") |

The corpus is the genesis block itself, 285 bytes, public since 2009-01-03

## What is understood

### Mechanism

The escrow is a native P2WSH output: the address encodes `sha256(witness script)`. The author
states the witness script is a multisig with two keys, both required, so the script is
`OP_2 <keyA> <keyB> OP_2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG` (71 bytes with compressed keys). The unknown is
the pair of keys and their order in the script (two cases, both checked by the oracle).

Reading of the hints, in the order they constrain the search:

1. "You can also use The Times newspaper" points at the one genesis field a newspaper
   contains: the coinbase text. Its first 32 bytes are exactly
   `The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor`, the size of a private key, which fits "Maybe both"
   as an answer to "32 bytes or smaller": likely one key on 32 bytes, the other on fewer.
2. "root -> multisig -> mainnet -> genesis_data -> script_type" is, word for word, the level
   order of BIP48: `m / 48' / 0' / account' / script_type'`, with a genesis value in the
   account slot. The nonce (2083236893), the timestamp and the bits value all fit under
   2^31, so all three are valid hardened indexes. Script type 2' is native P2WSH.
3. "Same field", "no hash", "derived independently": two roots built from the same text
   without an explicit SHA-256 step (raw bytes, a BIP32 seed, or BIP39 entropy), then the
   same BIP48 path; or one root and two accounts.
4. Since 2026-09-10 and 2026-09-11 the root is named: "root" is the BIP32 master key of a
   12-word BIP39 mnemonic, the mnemonic has a passphrase, its entropy is data from the
   genesis block, and "genesis_data" is a genesis value used as the BIP48 account number.
   A 12-word mnemonic carries 128 bits of entropy, so the entropy is a 16-byte window of
   the 285-byte block (or of one field, since both keys use the same field). The passphrase
   is the open unknown: the author says it exists, not what it is. The two keys being
   "derived independently" from the same field now reads as two 16-byte windows of that
   field (or one window with two accounts, or two passphrases). Passes 1 and 2 did not
   cover a non-empty passphrase, so their negatives do not touch this model.

### Derivation and oracle

```
python3 tools/oracle.py --selftest              # must print SELFTEST OK
python3 tools/oracle.py <keyA hex> <keyB hex>   # 32-byte private keys or 33/65-byte public keys
python3 tools/oracle.py --stdin                 # one "keyA keyB" pair per line
```

The oracle rebuilds the 2-of-2 script in both key orders, hashes it, and compares all 32
bytes with the published witness program
`4dae67a9872f1402109f9670276afc2c0758f895aafddcd089795771b7964833`. No network, no false
positive. Measured on one CPU core: about 1,200,000 pairs/s once public keys exist, about
37,000 private-to-public derivations/s in Python.

### Certified against

1. The BIP-173 test vector for a P2WSH program
   (`1863143c14c5166804bd19203356da136c985678cd4d27a1b8c6329604903262` to
   `bc1qrp33g0q5c5txsp9arysrx4k6zdkfs4nce4xj0gdcccefvpysxf3qccfmv3`).
2. A real 2-of-2 P2WSH spent in the same block as the announcement, transaction
   `47ded3504e855ce418e46eeca4694b55a623d1e23a8e3c83292abbcf9cee9f7a`, input 0: the two
   public keys revealed in its witness, rebuilt into the script, hash to the address of the
   output it spends, `bc1q6vpcc5vdrg0dh0k4edkuvamvn27mwr4crxgl94yva9v9z240vysqr89ddy`.
3. Private key 1 derives the generator point, compressed and uncompressed.
4. Negative control: that revealed pair does not match the escrow.

### Established facts

1. The escrow holds 168,779 sats in 24 unspent outputs as of 2026-09-12, checked on
   mempool.space (142,779 sats in 18 outputs on 2026-08-29). The first funding (20,000 sats) confirmed in block
   963,517 on 2026-08-22 02:45 UTC, 17 hours before the announcement.
2. Every payment sent with a question ends up in the escrow. Four questions were paid
   directly to the author's change addresses (12,909, 32,357, 6,465 and 12,963 sats); the
   author re-posted each question to the escrow with the same amount minus fees, then
   posted the answer. So the jackpot is the sum of all hint payments plus the author's
   own 30,000 sats. Traced from the transaction inputs in `data/on-chain-dialogue.json`.
3. The author uses a fresh P2WPKH change address for every message and keeps a separate
   1,000,000 sats output untouched (`bc1qw8uecdjvuedtkg4s2kku4s2ak9r2cm59khclfr`, funded
   2026-08-22 from the same source as the escrow). Response time to a paid question was
   between 1 and 10 hours in every case so far.
4. Only two wallets have asked questions: one asked 5 questions on 2026-08-23 and
   2026-08-24 (about 77,000 sats paid in total), the other asked 3 on 2026-08-28. The
   first one had split its coins into 5 equal outputs of 66,020 sats on 2026-08-06, 16
   days before the puzzle existed. I record this as an observation only.
5. The two 2026-08-28 answers ("The Times newspaper", the derivation rule) are absent from
   every press article I found; the articles cover the announcement and the first two
   answers, and report the jackpot at 125,779 sats, its value on 2026-08-24.
6. The word "genesis_data" sits exactly where BIP48 puts the account index; the nonce is
   the only genesis integer that lands under 2^31 by chance (time and bits do so by
   construction).
7. The literal readings of hints 7 and 8 do not produce the keys: 447,916 distinct public
   keys built from the coinbase text and the other genesis fields (raw windows, BIP32 seeds
   and BIP39 entropy along 214 paths including every BIP48 path with a genesis integer as
   account), paired every way, give 0 match against the escrow, with the witness pair
   re-found at head, middle and tail. 2.0e11 ordered pairs in 103 s on one RTX 5080,
   2026-08-29 (`analysis/tested.md`). The two 2026-08-28 hints therefore describe a
   construction with at least one step I have not modeled, most likely how "root" is built.
8. The library-specific root constructions do not produce the keys either: hashed roots
   (SHA-256, double SHA-256, hash160, SHA-512 of the text as key, seed or entropy), a raw
   64-byte extended key cut from the text, and a raw key with a zero chain code, along the
   same 214 paths, add 165,064 keys; the union of 611,008 keys paired every way gives 0
   match, witnesses re-found, 3.7e11 ordered pairs in 89 s, 2026-08-29. "root" is therefore
   not any standard function of the coinbase text on these paths.

## What has been tested

Full ledger in [analysis/tested.md](analysis/tested.md), including the exact list of texts,
windows, readings and derivation paths. Reproduce with `tools/candidates.py --write --pass 2`
(about 17 s on 22 cores) and `engines/p2wsh_2of2_pairs` (about 90 s on one RTX 5080), then
`tools/candidates.py --verify` on the hits file.

| Hypothesis | Space | Method | Result | Witness | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pass 1, families A to D: literal readings of hints 7 and 8 (raw keys, BIP32 seeds, BIP39 entropy from the coinbase text and the other fields, 214 paths), every ordered pair | 447,916 keys, 200,634,118,084 ordered pairs | CPU key generation (`tools/candidates.py`), GPU pairing and SHA-256 (`engines/p2wsh_2of2_pairs.cu`), exact 32-byte compare, every hit re-derived on CPU | 0 match | yes: revealed 2-of-2 pair at head, middle and tail, 9 of 9 ordered combinations re-found, `exhausted=yes` | 2026-08-29 |
| Pass 2, A to D plus E (hashed roots), F (raw 64-byte extended key from the text), G (raw key with zero chain code), same 214 paths, every ordered pair of the union | 611,008 keys, 373,338,108,196 ordered pairs | same pipeline, `tools/candidates.py --pass 2` | 0 match | yes: same witness protocol, 9 of 9 re-found, `exhausted=yes` | 2026-08-29 |
| Six further constructions by @BorisLoveDev (PR #21): the texts directly as BIP39 sentences, the newspaper date as an integer seed, a date-prefix mnemonic, text bytes as derivation-path indices, zero roots, and 15 hardening patterns over m/48'/0'/account/script | about 42 million new ordered pairs across the six families (1,648,656 + 26,378,496 + 2,060,820 + 576 + 732,736 + 11,150,784) | CPU pairing on the same 2-of-2 program, exact 32-byte compare | 0 match | yes: revealed pair at head, middle and tail; I replayed all six locally with identical counts | 2026-09-05 |
| Pass 3, the September model (2026-09-12): 12-word BIP39 mnemonic whose entropy is a 16-byte window of genesis data (every window of the raw 285-byte block, of the merkle root and block hash in both byte orders, of the coinbase text, headline, scriptSig, header and coinbase public key, plus the header integers zero-padded and as decimal strings: 329 entropies), 53 passphrases (empty as control, the coinbase text, the headline, The Times, Satoshi, genesis, bitcoin, the header integers, the hashes in hex and a dozen short words from the author's messages), BIP48 `m/48'/0'/a'/s'` with a in {0, 1, 2, 3, 50, 2009, 285, bits, time, nonce} and s in {0', 1', 2'}, suffix empty, /0/0 or /0/1; every ordered pair | 1,569,330 keys, 2.463e12 ordered pairs | CPU BIP39/BIP32 generation (25 s on 22 cores), GPU pairing and SHA-256 (`engines/p2wsh_2of2_pairs.cu`, 4.18e9 pairs/s, 589 s), exact 32-byte compare | 0 match | yes: revealed 2-of-2 pair at head, middle and tail, 9 of 9 ordered combinations re-found, `exhausted=yes` | 2026-09-12 |

## Open leads, ranked

1. **Ask the author for the passphrase's nature** (needs a person; 10,000 sats bought each
   September answer within the hour). Pass 3 (below, 2026-09-12) says that under the
   September model the passphrase is none of 53 obvious readings of the block, so it is the
   one unknown left. Draft, 79 bytes:
   `Passphrase: from genesis text/Times headline/other? Same 16 genesis bytes both keys?`
   The two questions drafted here on 2026-08-29 were sent by a reader on 2026-09-10 and
   2026-09-11 and both were answered; that is the working channel.
2. **Pass 3 wave 2** (about 15 minutes on one GPU): the same model with the coinbase text
   without spaces, lowercased, the hashes as hex ASCII, and every substring of the coinbase
   text (3 to 69 bytes) as passphrase. Cheap, but it only tests more guesses at the same
   unknown; the question above tests it directly.
3. **Watch the channel** (minutes). Re-read the escrow's transactions before any work:
   a new OP_RETURN from the author's change chain is a new constraint; a spend closes the
   puzzle. The author's current change address (unspent on 2026-09-12) is
   `bc1qw720l9e6g4a675vfraghzm93gvyw8s2fjgtdxy`; it moves with every message.
