# Zden Cryptopuzzle LVL.5 (555,550 sats, [SOLVED])

**Swept on 2026-09-22.** The escrow `1cryptoGeCRiTzVgxBQcKFFjSVydN1GW7` was emptied in block 968,171 by
[transaction e2544433](https://mempool.space/tx/e2544433184d0fe4157ca10a8e1ce753bb52a7b0bbcf833740d7448ed25e8e8e),
551,745 sats to `bc1qw50q83k7psugw5z5548kwnxqqjxjxvx2pkvz0s`, a plain spend with no message,
reported in [issue #34](https://github.com/floflo777/open-crypto-puzzles/issues/34) by deviceio121.
Nobody has published the key or the reading of the hint as of 2026-09-26. The research below is
kept as it stood; if the solver reads this, an issue with the derivation gets full credit here.

## The puzzle as published

The puzzle is a single published image, `crypto5.png`, announced 2018-11-09 with the caption
"Level 5 - Find the private key in this image." A hint bundle followed on 2018-12-24: "Sum of
two consecutive following rectangles areas creates one byte of the private key. Apply more
operations to obtain the results in byte range." On 2021-12-12, after the puzzle had gone 3
years unsolved, the author republished the image as `crypto5fix.png` with the note "the
original release was uncomplete," struck out the word "consecutive" from the hint, and added
2 short white pixel lines plus a small 4-line pixel formula in the image's bottom-left
corner. No rectangle geometry changed between the two versions. Full quotes with links are in
[clues/author-posts.md](clues/author-posts.md).

## What is understood

### Mechanism

The image shows 64 rectangles in row-major 8x8 order. Each exposes 3 measurable quantities:
outer area (width times height), inner area (the area inside its border), and the shell (the
difference between the two). The hint states that the sum of 2 "following" rectangles' areas,
after an unspecified operation, forms 1 byte of the private key: 32 such bytes make the
256-bit key. The author's own MATLAB measurement script (in the community repository, see
Sources) defines 4 candidate spatial senses of "following" (simple consecutive order,
column blocks, column-major pairs, and interleaved columns). The 2021 pixel hint reads, once
corrected for an earlier transcription error, as "-1 times x plus 64 divided by x," where "x"
most likely refers to a per-rectangle border-thickness measurement, though this binding is
not confirmed by the author. The key is understood to be direct hex, not a WIF or BIP39
encoding: a base58/WIF character-stream reading was tried and never produces a valid checksum
(see [analysis/tested.md](analysis/tested.md)).

### Derivation and oracle

```
python3 tools/oracle.py --selftest
python3 tools/oracle.py "<64 hex chars>"
```

`MATCH <address> (<compressed|uncompressed>)` on a hit, `NO MATCH` otherwise, exit 0 or 1.
This oracle checks a finished 32-byte key candidate against the escrow; it does not implement
the still-open rectangle-to-key reading itself.

### Certified against

`tools/oracle.py --selftest` reproduces the address for private key 1 (the generator point),
a standard vector reproduced in Bitcoin educational material, unrelated to this puzzle. This
certifies the derivation pipeline (secp256k1, hash160, base58check) used by the oracle. The
rectangle geometry is separately certified: my measurements reproduce the author's own
published MATLAB script output on all 64 rectangles, exactly.

### Established facts

1. I confirmed the escrow is funded and unspent as of 2026-08-16 (checked via
   [mempool.space](https://mempool.space)), across 4 funding transactions from 2018-10-20 to
   2021-12-03.
2. My rectangle measurements (`data/rectangle-measurements.csv`) reproduce the author's own
   canonical output exactly, on all 64 rectangles, by 2 independent measurement methods.
3. The 2018 and 2021 images are pixel-identical except for 2 short white lines and the
   bottom-left mini-hint; no rectangle geometry changed.

## What has been tested

Full ledger in [analysis/tested.md](analysis/tested.md). Summary:

| Hypothesis | Volume | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Mini-hint formula bound to every channel, pairing and normalization | over 3,200 families | 0 match |
| Composed operations, offsets, 2-stage divide-and-modulo | about 3,000 keys | 0 match |
| Base/radix readings, nibble model, date-matrix reading | thousands of keys | 0 match |
| 1-byte author-error tolerance across 2,699 bases | about 155 million derivations | 0 match |
| 2-byte author-error tolerance across 12 bases | about 390 million derivations | 0 match |
| Raw sum over a constant divisor, 6 traversal orders | 212,406 configurations | 0 match |
| "Following" as a sorted-order neighbor | 153,736 unique keys | 0 match |

All of the above predate this folder's certified oracle; every row is reported as candidates
consumed, not as a witnessed negative in this project's strict sense.

## Open leads, ranked

1. **A clarification from the author on 3 exact bindings** (needs a person). What "x" means
   in the formula, the exact byte-range normalization, and the exact sense of "following."
   Full details in [analysis/leads.md](analysis/leads.md).
2. **A higher-fidelity source for the mini-hint glyphs** (needs new information).
3. **A wider author-error tolerance sweep** (bounded, low priority). About 660 million
   derivations per base tried, marginal expected value against lead 1.

## Solution

Swept on 2026-09-22 (block 968,171, [tx `e2544433`](https://mempool.space/tx/e2544433184d0fe4157ca10a8e1ce753bb52a7b0bbcf833740d7448ed25e8e8e)), 551,745 sats to `bc1qw50q83k7psugw5z5548kwnxqqjxjxvx2pkvz0s`, a plain spend with no message, after almost 8 years unsolved. Reported in [issue #34](https://github.com/floflo777/open-crypto-puzzles/issues/34). The solver did not announce and the reading of the hint's 3 undefined terms is not public; the sweep went to a fresh single-use address, which is consistent with a solver claiming the prize rather than the author reclaiming it, but this is not confirmed. If the solver reads this, a write-up gets full credit here.
